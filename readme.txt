guide 2 curls:
1: drag the script into your unity project and apply it on your preferred hand, left or right.
2: select which hand you are putting the script on, left or right hand.
3: select each part of each finger, for the index finger select the tip knuckle and bottom of the index fingers rig, do the same for each finger.
4: select which rotational axis you want to rotate the fingers in, if you want to curl the fingers in the direction of your palm like in real life rotate on of the fingers in the desired direction. for me it was -z but it could be anything
if its x check x if its -x check x and inverse rotation if its y check y if its -y check y etc etc, once you select your rotational axis and if its negative (as in -x and such) hit play, if your fingers go backwards or the opposite way you want them to
select the inverse rotation option. and from there you are good and have set it up! will be doing a video tutorial later on and link it here.
